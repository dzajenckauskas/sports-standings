### TASK DESCRIPTION ###
### Front-End Technical Challenge – Sports Standings App

### Goal

Build a Single Page Application (SPA) to manage sports tournaments. There should be three
tables: Premier League, Eurobasket, Wimbledon. Users can add teams/players, input match results,
and view a dynamically updated standings table.

### Requirements

## Functionality
+ Users can add teams/players (start at 0 points).
• Each team/player can play only once against any other.
+ Scoring system:
    - Win: 3 pts
    - Draw: 1 pt
    - Loss: 0 pts
+ Standings table auto-updates and sorts by points.
• Table shows: Matches Played (P/M), Wins (W), Draws (D), Losses (L), Points (Pts)
+ Data must persist after refresh.
+ Use React or React + Redux.
• Must follow SPA principles.
• Frequent commits. Host code on GitHub.

## Designs
1. Clean & Minimal
• Layout: 3 columns – Add Team, Add Score, Standings Table
• Style: Neutral colors (white, gray, blue), modern sans-serif (Inter, Roboto)

2. Sporty & Energetic
• Layout: 3 columns – Add buttons, Match Results, Standings
• Style: Bold colors (green/orange), athletic fonts (Montserrat, Bebas Neue), flag icons

3. Table-Centric
• Layout: 2 columns – Add buttons, Standings
• Style: Cool neutrals, monospace font (Space Mono), icons for win/loss

All designs must be responsive and support auto-scroll if many teams.

## Bonus
• TypeScript
• Mobile-first design
• Modular component structure

## Submission
• Deploy the app (e.g. GitHub Pages, Vercel, Netlify).
• Share the GitHub repo with setup instructions.




<!-- # Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
